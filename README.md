The manual process of shorting wire combinations and measuring electrical 
values is error-prone task, particularly when dealing with large sets of wires. In this 
project, we address these challenges by developing an automated system designed to 
streamline and enhance the efficiency of this process. Our system focuses on a set of 62 
wires and aims to automate the selection, shorting, and measurement of wire 
combinations, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional manual methods. 
The proposed solution involves integrating electronic relays or solid state 
relays with a programmable microcontroller to manage the shorting of wire 
combinations. The system is designed to select wire combinations, establish 
connections with minimal manual intervention. 
By automating these procedures, the project aims to achieve several key objectives: 
1. Enhanced Efficiency: Accelerate the process of wire pair testing by 
automating the selection task, thus reducing overall testing time. 
2. Increased Accuracy: Eliminate human errors associated with manual wire 
handling, ensuring more reliable and consistent results. 
3. Improved Reliability: Provide a robust and systematic approach for testing 
multiple wire combinations, leading to more dependable data and streamlined 
operations. 
This automated system simplifies the testing process, paving the way for more 
efficient and accurate electronic diagnostics.
